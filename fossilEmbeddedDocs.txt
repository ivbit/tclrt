Fossil developers have moved from the 'wiki' to 'embedded project documentation',
and from 'tickets' to the 'forum'.

https://fossil-scm.org/forum/forumpost/f9963149a311944b

The ability to apply attachments is a 'historical' one - it was derived from
Fossil's spiritual ancestor, CVSTrac, which provided the initial baseline of
functionality fossil aimed to include. Even before fossil got 'embedded docs',
attachments were not a feature we made any significant use outside of tickets,
so they have not been really be touched in all these years.
And we now prefer the forum to the ticket tracker except in rare cases where
specific problems needs to be formally recorded (which is exceedingly rare in
this project, but happens now and then in Fossil's sibling project, SQLite).
